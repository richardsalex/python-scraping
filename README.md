We'll use a few helpful Python packages to create a web scraper.

**This session will cover:**

- Why you'd ever want to do this  
- Fetching web pages with Python
- Navigating HTML
- Structuring scraped data and writing it to a CSV

**Software requirements:**

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
- [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
- [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
- [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)

(If you already have Python 3, `pip install -r requirements.txt` after downloading this repository for everything you need.)
